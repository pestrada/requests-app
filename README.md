# Requests-App

The App allows to create, vote, approve and reject requests.
The goal was to experiment integrating:
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React Material Design](https://react-mdl.github.io/react-mdl/)
- [Babel](http://babeljs.io/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
